Your task is to recreate this interface using Next.js, React, and appropriate styling techniques. This challenge will test your frontend development skills, attention to detail, and ability to implement modern UI designs.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

2. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see your implementation.

## Challenge Requirements

- Use tailwindcss for styling
- Create reusable components where appropriate
- Follow best practices for accessibility
- Ensure clean, well-organized code structure

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

- Visual accuracy compared to the demo image
